Service workers enable graceful degradation when starting out with full JavaScript functionality in an application. They help to handle cases where users may have a slow network connection or no network connection by storing requests in the browser. This means that even when network connections are slow or non-existent, because the request content is stored, the web application will still be able to function by retrieving the stored content from the browser rather than over the network.
